# Bank Branch Consolidation in Japan: Spatial-Temporal Boundary Analysis

This project applies the boundary detection framework developed in 
[Regime-Switch-Dynamics](https://github.com/Tatsuru-Kikuchi/Regime-Swithch-Dynamics) 
to analyze Japanese bank branch consolidation.

## Installation

First install the theoretical framework:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Tatsuru-Kikuchi/Regime-Swithch-Dynamics.git
